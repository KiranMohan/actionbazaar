Instructions
============
All of the chapters are Maven based. The code samples were tested on the 
   GlassFish 4.1 application servers. The code may be 
   imported in IDEs supporting Maven. Eclipse was used for updating project 
   structure and dependencies in Oct 2015.

See the respective <module>/readme.txt for instructions
Note: You may need to add a maven profile in your $HOME/.m2/settings.xml for
	your glassfish configurations. Just google for instructions.
